This system is meant to keep track of how many cows/livestock there are.
Also its meant to keep track of each cows lineage. 

What we want to keep track of is the:
# livestock
- Id of the livestock
- age of the livestock
- gender
- medical history(immunizations)
- how many births

# Livestock_Register.Lineage
- Id of livestock that corresponds with mother
- age
- gender
- medical history(immunizations)
- how many births
- *-alerts of when to ween-*

# Keep track of the feed
- the feed
