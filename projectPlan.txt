Make Lineage the parent class as every livestock has to come from a certain lineage. (Done)

The Livestock class will be a subclass of Lineage and will have all the information we need on the livestock.
Therefor we won't need to have the Lineage list in the DustCommanderFarm class as Livestock 
will have the information we need regarding that livestock and lineage. (Done)

The main reason I used a hashMap is because when trying to find a cattle by ID it is easier to find
with a hashMap because of built-in functions and this will also allows to when if we find it or not. (Done)

Since the DustCommanderFarm will contain a hashMap that points to the Livestock class we will now just have to query
the hashMap by trying to get the id of the Livestock if we want information on just one cattle or use the Lineage id to get
all the the information regarding cattle of a certain lineage. (Done)

We do not need the getters and setters in the DustCommanderFarm class as we already have them in the Livestock class.
